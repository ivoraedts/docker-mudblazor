### Docker-Mudblazor

This project just started with me playing around with a MudBlazor-project that I run with Docker on my Synology.

I made add some more documentation when I feel like playing around with [markdown stuff](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).
